copy keys.enc and .key files to mysql config folder (usually /etc/mysql/ in Unix, where config file is located)

comment lines 1, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 of medical-records/src/main/resources/dbconfig and check if file paths for the keys are correct

copy dbconfig file contents to mysql config file (ususally /etc/mysql/my.cnf in Unix)

restart mariadb service

access mariadb and insert the following statement:
INSTALL PLUGIN file_key_management SONAME 'file_key_management.so';
(if on windows use file_key_management.dll)

uncomment the lines previously commented

remove the .key file from the config folder and it's good to go

everytime the mariadb service starts, the key must be in the the config folder
