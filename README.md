Network and Computer Security Project - Medical Records

## Introduction
Health care institutions gather and store sensitive information from patients with the goal of 
providing the best care possible. The medical history of a patient is essential to allow correct 
diagnostic and help the clinical staff act in the shortest time possible. This information is 
highly sensitive and must be kept private for the responsible staff only. At the same time, the 
medical records should be accessible by any health care institution to ensure that a patient 
can be assisted anywhere. 

To guarantee data availability, health care institutions in the future might rely on data 
repositories accessible through the Internet. This poses a threat, since patient data can be 
accessed by unauthorized personnel. It is also extremely difficult to manage access to data 
using standard access control mechanisms due to the vast amounts of user, groups and 
patients and the constant adjustment in privileges that must be done to maintain patientâ€™s 
confidentiality. 

In this topic we define a cloud-based system to store medical records. The records 
are available for a wide range of users, so the system provides a web interface to manage 
access privileges to the records. We use Atribute Based Access Control (ABAC) and the standard 
architecture XACML was implemented using [AuthzForce](https://github.com/authzforce/core). More information can be found in the report under **/docs**.

## Requirements
You must have installed the following tools:
- Maven 3.x.x 
- Java Development Kit 8 (JDK 8)
- MariaDB 10.x
- Java Keytool (you must have a command alias for Java Keytool "keytool") in order to generate keys.

Also check if JAVA_HOME and M2_HOME are set properly.

## Getting Started

- By default the port 8080 accepts HTTP requests and redirects them to port 8443 as HTTPS requests (This only work with GET)

- You can change the ports in **/medical-records/server/src/main/resources/application.properties** changing the

properties **_server.http.port_** and **_server.port_** respectively.


### Setup MariaDB

- Rename the file **/medical-records/server/src/main/resources/database.properties.example** to 
**database.properties** and fill it with your database credentials. According to your OS follow
the next instructions to setup the encryption of MariaDB.

#### Linux:

- Copy the files ***medical-records/server/src/main/resources/keys.enc*** and ***medical-records/src/main/resources/.key*** to mysql config folder (usually **/etc/mysql/**, where config file is located)

- Comment lines 2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 of **medical-records/server/src/main/resources/dbconfig-linux**, and check if the file paths for the keys are correct.

- Copy ***dbconfig-linux*** file contents to mysql config file (usually **/etc/mysql/my.cnf**)

- Restart mariadb service

- Access mariadb and insert the following statement:
```
	INSTALL PLUGIN file_key_management SONAME 'file_key_management.so';
```

- Uncomment the lines previously commented (2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12)

- Remove the ***.key*** file from the config folder and it's good to go

- Everytime the mariadb service starts, the key must be in the the config folder

#### MacOs (with Homebrew):

- Copy the files ***medical-records/server/src/main/resources/keys.enc*** and ***medical-records/server/src/main/resources/.key*** to mysql config folder (usually **/usr/local/var/mysql/**, where config file is located)

- Comment lines 2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 of **medical-records/src/main/resources/dbconfig-macos**, and check if the file paths for the keys are correct.

- Copy ***dbconfig-macos*** file contents to mysql config file (usually **/usr/local/etc/my.cnf**)

- Restart mariadb service

- Access mariadb and insert the following statement:
```
	INSTALL PLUGIN file_key_management SONAME 'file_key_management.so';
```

- Uncomment the lines previously commented (2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12)

- Remove the ***.key*** file from the config folder and it's good to go

- Everytime the mariadb service starts, the key must be in the the config folder

#### Windows 10:

- Copy the files ***/medical-records/server/src/main/resources/keys.enc*** and ***medical-records/server/src/main/resources/.key*** 
to mysql config folder (usually **C:\Program Files\MariaDB X.X\data\\**, where config file is located)

- Copy ***dbconfig-windows*** file contents to mysql config file (usually **C:\Program Files\MariaDB X.X\data\my.ini**)

- Restart mariadb service

- Everytime the mariadb service starts, the key must be in the the config folder

## How to run
The first time you want to run the project you need to run the following command in **/medical-records/**:

```
mvn clean install
```

If there are tests failing, something is not well configured. Check section Debugging.

### Server
Run the following command in the directory **/medical-records/server/** 
#### Server 1:

```
mvn clean spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="1099"  -Dserver.port="8081"
```

#### Server 2:

```
mvn clean spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="1098"  -Dserver.port="8082"
```


### Front-end
Run the following command in the directory **/medical-records/front-end/**

```
mvn clean spring-boot:run
```


## Debugging
### Handle possible SAXParseException

#### Failed to read schema document 'xml.xsd', because 'http' access is not allowed due to restriction set by the accessExternalSchema property.
Create a file named **jaxp.properties** (if it doesn't exist) under **/\<path to jdk1.8.0>/jre/lib** and then write this line in it:
```
javax.xml.accessExternalSchema = all
```
